# The Green Clock
The Green Clock is a simple project that tracks how close my girlfriend and I are to each yearly anniversary.  The website is composed of a single heart shapoe divided into 52 blocks, each representing 1 week of time.  Each week that passes from Augest 13th, a new block at random will be filled in green.  After 1 year, all blocks will be filled in and the heart will be complete.
